# ScreenGuardian Project

## Project Overview
This project is a screen protector price comparison website, focusing on the visual layout and structure without populating it with actual data. The website is designed to help users compare screen protector prices for various devices.

## Current State
The project currently consists of:

1. **HTML Structure (index.html)**
   - Header with navigation (Smartphones, Tablets, Watches, About)
   - Filter section with dropdowns (Make, Model) and checkboxes
   - Results table (empty) with columns for screen protector attributes (Product, Device, Price, Material, Rating, Affiliate Link)
   - Footer with centered copyright information

2. **CSS Styling (styles/main.css)**
   - Responsive design
   - Modern color scheme with blue accents
   - Table layout for displaying products
   - Filter controls styling
   - Mobile-friendly design with media queries
   - Sticky footer that remains at the bottom of the viewport

3. **JavaScript Functionality (scripts/main.js)**
   - Filter event listeners for Make, Model, In Stock, and Sort By
   - Dynamic model selection based on chosen make
   - Placeholder functions for filtering and displaying products
   - Placeholder for price history functionality

## Technologies Used
- HTML5

## Next Steps
Potential future enhancements:
- Add actual screen protector product data
